# The High Noon Duel
This game was made to be the holiday season hit of 1986. It was released in response
to the very well received film `Two small town`. It even caused a shortage of coins
in the cities where it was released into the arcades.
 
Unfortunately this game was thought to be lost to corporate greed over licensing issues. 
The film company chose to destroy all copies of the game along with all source to prevent any 
lawsuits. As such this game was thought lost.

The source code for this version only survived on punch cards because of a filling error
at a local library where it was filled under `The High Noon Duel` named after the most famous
scene in the movie. This is as close to a original reproduction as is possible after
recoding the punch card data to python.
